# Mobile Agents Simulation

This java program is to simulate the spread of a fire across many interconneted nodes, and to test the "Mobile Agents" that monitor and attach themselves to each node. 

## Getting Started

The game's source code is located in the corresponding archives, and the jars are available for download. Either using the jars or the sorce code, will you be able to reproduce a working game.

### Prerequisites

Java SDK 10 is the primary version of Java that this application was written in.

### Running

All settings are configured inside the code, as there is not much left up to the user to decide upon.

## GUI Simulation!

## Assumptions

The initial game settings are up to specifications set by professor Chenoweth and if modifications are made, the risk is inheritable upon the changer.
